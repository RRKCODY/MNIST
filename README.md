Developed and trained an AI model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model effectively learned to classify digits (0â€“9) based on pixel intensity features, achieving high accuracy through rigorous training and validation. Demonstrated strong applicability in optical character recognition and real-time digit classification tasks.
